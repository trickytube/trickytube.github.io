18/01/2026 --> we no longer will support url on cover with this commit, the new image directory for news cover images is "/src/assets/news". although I am planning to intigrate a cms, so this is a decision I had to make in order to the process go smoother, I added the image resolver function on the "/src/lib/resolveNewsImage.ts", which will resolve the images from now on. for now how it basiclaly works is I put the cover image on "/src/assets/news" and mention the filename (not full path!) on my article as image: "filename", which resolves the image, but failing to render any image causes the whole site to crash, so I need to handle that exception later!
