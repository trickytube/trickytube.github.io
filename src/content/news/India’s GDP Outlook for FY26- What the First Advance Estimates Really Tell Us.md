Every year, before the Union Budget is presented, the Indian government releases an important economic document known as the **First Advance Estimates of GDP** . For the financial year 2025–26 (FY26), these estimates have once again attracted a lot of attention because they give us an early picture of how the Indian economy is performing and where it might be heading.
These estimates are published by the **Ministry of Statistics and Program Implementation** and are usually released in early January. Although they are called “advance” estimates, they play a very big role in shaping policy decisions, especially the Union Budget. In simple words, this data helps the government decide how much it can spend, where it should spend, and how confident it should be about future growth.
### What Are First Advance Estimates?
First Advance Estimates are preliminary calculations of India’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for an ongoing or upcoming financial year. Since the full year’s data is not yet available, these estimates are prepared using partial information, trends, and economic indicators.
Despite being preliminary, they are extremely important because they give a directional signal about the economy’s health. Investors, policymakers, economists, and even global institutions closely track these numbers to understand whether the economy is accelerating, slowing down, or staying stable.

### GDP Growth projection for FY26
According to the First Advance Estimates, India’s real GDP growth for FY26 is projected at 7.4%. This is a notable improvement compared to the previous fiscal year, which saw growth around 6.5%. Along with this, nominal GDP growth is estimated at about 8%, reflecting both real growth and inflation effects.
This projection places India among the fastest-growing major economies in the world, especially at a time when many countries are struggling with slow growth, high interest rates, and global uncertainty.

### Key Drivers Behind the Growth
One of the most positive aspects of the FY26 estimates is that growth is not coming from just one sector. Instead, multiple areas of the economy are contributing:
#### Manufacturing Sector
Manufacturing is expected to grow by around 7%, showing a recovery driven by domestic demand, infrastructure projects, and government support to production-linked industries.
#### Services Sector
The services sector continues to be the backbone of the Indian economy. With a projected growth of 9.1%, it remains the largest contributor to GDP. IT services, finance, trade, transport, and tourism are all playing an important role here.
#### Household Consumption
Private consumption, which reflects how much households are spending, is growing at around 7%. This indicates improving consumer confidence, stable employment conditions, and better income prospects.
#### Investment and Government Spending
Capital expenditure by the government, especially on roads, railways, and digital infrastructure, continues to push growth. Private investment is also slowly picking up, supported by policy stability and demand recovery.
#### Alignment with Other Forecasts
India’s optimistic outlook is not limited to government data alone. Several major institutions have also revised their growth forecasts upwards. These include the Reserve Bank of India, the Asian Development Bank, and Fitch Ratings. Their assessments broadly align with the government’s view that India’s growth momentum remains strong.

### Government Measures Supporting Growth
 Growth forecasts have been influenced by several government policy reforms such as 
 - rationalization of GST and tax relief measures
 - Focus on export diversification to reduce dependency on limited markets
 - Increased capital spending on infrastructure
 - Policy support to manufacturing and MSMEs
These steps aim to create a more resilient and self-sustaining growth model.
### Expected Risks/ Downside Pressure
  Despite the positive outlook, the estimates also acknowledge certain risks. Global trade remains sluggish, capital flows can be volatile, and currency pressures may continue. Geopolitical tensions and uncertain global demand could affect exports. Additionally, agricultural growth depends heavily on weather conditions, which always remains a concern.

### Conclusion
Overall, the First Advance Estimates for FY26 shows a largely positive picture of the Indian economy, backed by strong domestic demand, services-led growth, and consistent government support. While challenges remain, India appears well-positioned to maintain its growth trajectory in a difficult global environment.
