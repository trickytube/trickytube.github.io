## Trickytube’s Quick Summary
- U.S.–Islamic world relations are driven primarily by oil and power, not values
- America has repeatedly engineered regime changes to protect strategic interests
- Allies and enemies shift based on convenience, not consistency
- Short-term gains have led to long-term global instability
- International politics prioritizes advantage over ideology

**What if everything you were told about global politics was only half the truth?**

For decades, the United States has positioned itself as a defender of democracy, human rights, and global stability. Yet, when you trace its relationship with Islamic nations since World War II, a far more uncomfortable pattern emerges—one driven less by values and more by crude oil, strategic dominance, and geopolitical survival.

This relationship has never been simple. It has been contradictory, transactional, and at times, deeply destabilizing—not just for the Middle East, but for the entire world.
### Oil Before Ideals
At the heart of U.S. involvement in the Islamic world lies a single obsession: energy security. After World War II, America understood one thing clearly—**control over oil meant control over global power**. The Middle East, rich in crude reserves, became a chessboard where no single nation was allowed to grow too strong.

During the Cold War, U.S. strategy wasn’t about promoting freedom; it was about preventing any Middle Eastern country from gaining enough autonomy to threaten American access to oil. Stability mattered—but only the kind that served the US.
### Engineering Regimes: Syria and Iran
One of the earliest examples was Syria in 1949. The U.S. backed a military coup that replaced an elected government with a pro-American dictator. Why? Because the new regime approved the Trans-Arabian Pipeline and crushed communist influence. Democracy became expendable the moment it interfered with oil logistics.

Iran followed a similar fate in 1953. When Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh moved to nationalize Iran’s oil—previously controlled by Western companies—the U.S. orchestrated his removal. Iran was transformed from a functioning democracy into a monarchy loyal to Western interests.

Ironically, the U.S. later initiated Iran’s nuclear program—an uncomfortable fact considering today’s rhetoric around Iranian nuclear ambitions. This single contradiction alone exposes how flexible “principles” become when strategic interests are at stake.
### When Allies Become Obstacles
**[The 1956 Suez Canal Crisis](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suez_Crisis&ved=2ahUKEwiV7-z1866SAxVYTmwGHXTJKqoQFnoECB8QAQ&usg=AOvVaw2CY69PKq1uEvjosXVhX1Ec)** marked a turning point. Instead of backing its traditional allies Britain and France, the U.S. sided with Egypt. This wasn’t about justice—it was a power move. America wanted to make it clear that the Middle East now answered to the US, not Europe.

The result? Britain and France were humiliated, and the U.S. emerged as the uncontested Western authority in the region.
### Iraq: From Ally to Enemy
Few cases highlight U.S. opportunism better than Iraq.
During the Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s, the U.S. openly supported Iraq—even while knowing it possessed chemical weapons. Why? Because weakening Iran aligned with American economic and strategic goals.

Fast forward a decade, and Iraq suddenly became the villain. In 1991, the U.S. led a coalition against Saddam Hussein. In 2003, it invaded again—this time citing terrorism and weapons of mass destruction. Those weapons were never found, but the oil was always there.

It’s hard to ignore the implication: morality often arrives after resources are secured.
### Afghanistan: Creating Tomorrow’s Enemies
Perhaps the most tragic irony unfolded in Afghanistan. In 1979, the U.S. funded and trained Mujahideen fighters to counter the Soviet invasion. These fighters were armed, radicalized, and empowered—only to later morph into global terror networks.

The long-term cost of this decision became painfully clear on September 11, 2001.

Here’s the uncomfortable truth: short-term geopolitical wins often plant the seeds for long-term chaos. Afghanistan wasn’t a mistake—it was a calculated risk that spiraled out of control.
### Saudi Arabia: Silence for Stability
If values truly guided U.S. foreign policy, its relationship with Saudi Arabia would be impossible to justify.
Despite well-documented human rights abuses, the U.S. has consistently provided unconditional military and economic support to the Saudi regime. The reason is simple: stable oil supply at controlled prices and alignment with American foreign policy goals.

Human rights concerns surface only when they don’t interfere with economic interests. When they do, silence becomes policy.
### Israel and the Arab World
From the very beginning, the U.S. positioned itself firmly behind Israel—recognizing it first and providing consistent military and financial support. This alliance came at the cost of alienating many Arab and Islamic nations, further deepening regional divides.

Yet from US perspective, Israel represents a strategic foothold in a volatile region—an investment worth defending at almost any diplomatic cost.
### The Bigger Truth
The most important takeaway is brutally simple: international relations are not governed by ideology. They are governed by interest.

Democracy, human rights, and moral responsibility are often narratives—not drivers—of foreign policy. The U.S. didn’t invent this approach, but it has mastered it.

And the consequences? Endless cycles of instability, mistrust, and blowback that continue to define global politics today.

## FAQs
#### Why does the U.S. prioritize the Middle East so heavily?
Because the region holds a significant portion of the world’s oil reserves and sits at critical geopolitical crossroads.
#### Did the U.S. really overthrow democratic governments?
Yes, historical evidence shows U.S. involvement in regime changes when elected leaders threatened Western economic interests.
#### Why is Saudi Arabia treated differently from other countries?
Its role as a stable oil supplier and strategic ally outweighs human rights concerns in U.S. foreign policy calculations.
#### Is ideology ever important in global politics?
It matters rhetorically—but national interest usually decides final actions.
