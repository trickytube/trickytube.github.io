title: Zero Tariff for Bangladesh. What Does That Mean for India’s $176 Billion
  Textile Industry?
excerpt: A new US–Bangladesh trade arrangement offering zero tariffs on select
  garments has triggered fresh concerns for India’s textile sector. With the US
  being India’s largest apparel market, the implications go far beyond a minor
  tariff gap. Here’s a deep dive into what’s at stake, why it matters, and what
  India must do next.

## TrickyTube’s Quick Summary

* India’s textile industry is worth $176 billion but exports have slowed.
* The US is India’s largest apparel export market.
* Bangladesh now gets zero tariffs on select garments made using US-origin cotton.
* Even small tariff differences can shift large global orders.
* Indian cotton exports to Bangladesh may face pressure.
* Structural reforms and scale integration are urgently needed.

### The Real Shock: A 0% Clause That Changes the Game

Sometimes it’s not a war or a recession that hits an industry-it’s a single clause in a trade agreement.

The newly structured US–Bangladesh trade understanding includes a zero-tariff provision for selected garments made using US-origin cotton or man-made fibers. On paper, that sounds technical. In reality, it could quietly reshape the competitive balance in the global apparel market — and India is directly in the line of impact.

Let’s unpack this properly.

### India’s Textile Industry: Big, Powerful… But Vulnerable

India’s textile sector isn’t small by any stretch. It is the second-largest employer after agriculture, supporting more than 45 million workers. That alone shows how deeply this industry is woven into the country’s economic fabric.

India is also:

* The world’s second-largest fiber producer
* A global cotton powerhouse
* A $176 billion textile market

Out of that, $139 billion comes from domestic consumption, while $37 billion comes from exports. The long-term ambition? A bold target of $100 billion in textile exports.

But here’s the uncomfortable truth — exports haven’t been growing the way policymakers hoped. In fact, after touching around $43.4 billion in FY 2021-22, the numbers have slipped in subsequent years. That slowdown was already a concern. The new US–Bangladesh dynamic adds another layer of pressure.

### The US Market: India’s Most Crucial Customer

The United States is India’s largest textile and apparel export destination. Any policy shift there matters — a lot.

During the US–China trade tensions, many American buyers adopted the “China Plus One” strategy. The idea was simple: reduce dependency on China by diversifying sourcing to other countries.

Countries like Vietnam and Bangladesh moved quickly. They scaled aggressively, ensured cost competitiveness, and expanded large manufacturing units.

India, despite its strengths, struggled to capture the full benefit of this shift. Why?

**One word: fragmentation.**

A large part of India’s textile industry is MSME-driven. While MSMEs are strong and resilient, they often lack the scale needed for massive global orders. Large-scale integrated production — something Bangladesh excels at — remains limited in India.

### The Tariff Equation: Why 0% Matters More Than 1%

India negotiated tariff reductions in its own trade engagement with the US — bringing duties down significantly from earlier levels. That was seen as a win.

But Bangladesh’s new advantage is different.

For selected garments made using US-origin cotton or synthetic fibers, tariffs drop to zero.

At first glance, a 1% difference may sound negligible. But in global trade, margins are razor-thin. Even a fractional cost edge can shift millions of dollars’ worth of orders.

US retailers operate on scale. If sourcing from Bangladesh saves even a small percentage per shipment, that compounds into substantial annual savings. For procurement managers, that’s a straightforward business decision.

And Bangladesh already has:

* Lower labor costs
* Large integrated manufacturing clusters
* High-volume production capability

Combine that with zero tariff access — and the competitive pressure intensifies.

### The Cotton Ripple Effect

The implications don’t stop at finished garments.

India exports significant volumes of cotton yarn to Bangladesh. Historically, Bangladesh has relied heavily on Indian cotton inputs.

But under the new structure, if Bangladesh imports US-origin cotton to qualify for zero tariffs, its dependence on Indian cotton could decline.

That’s where things get sensitive.

If Bangladesh shifts sourcing patterns:

* Indian yarn exports may weaken
* Cotton farmers could face indirect pressure
* The entire upstream supply chain feels the impact

This isn’t just about garment factories. It touches farm incomes, rural employment, and export earnings.

***In my view,*** this is the part policymakers should watch most closely — because agricultural linkages amplify the impact far beyond factory floors.

### Why Bangladesh Has the Edge — Structurally

Let’s be clear: this isn’t just about tariffs.

Bangladesh has spent years building:

* Large-scale apparel clusters
* Export-oriented industrial zones
* Strong buyer relationships in the US

Its cost base is lower. Its manufacturing ecosystem is tightly integrated.

India, by contrast, still operates with fragmentation across spinning, weaving, processing, and garmenting. While capabilities exist, integration isn’t always seamless.

That structural difference matters when global brands want speed, scale, and consistency.

### The Way Forward: What India Must Do — Fast

This is not a crisis — but it is a wake-up call.

India’s textile ambitions cannot rely only on tariff negotiations. Structural reforms are critical.

Initiatives like the ***[PM MITRA](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.india.gov.in/spotlight/pm-mega-integrated-textile-region-and-apparel-pm-mitra&ved=2ahUKEwjIwc-Hy9SSAxUOfvUHHR4uIcsQFnoECBwQAQ&usg=AOvVaw0yFmGfY4sEDlBNI5dRgxSA)*** mega textile park scheme aim to create large, integrated manufacturing hubs. If implemented efficiently, they could address the scale problem.

Key priorities going forward:

* Accelerate integrated textile parks
* Support cotton farmers through diversification and productivity improvements
* Move up the value chain — focus on branding, technical textiles, and high-margin segments
* Improve logistics and reduce compliance complexity
* Strengthen global marketing of “Brand India” textiles

India has raw material strength. It has workforce depth. What it now needs is sharper execution and scale alignment.

Because in global trade, momentum shifts quickly — and regaining lost ground is always harder than protecting it.

## FAQs

#### 1. Why is the US-Bangladesh deal important for India?

Because the US is India’s largest textile export market, and zero tariffs give Bangladesh a competitive edge in selected categories.

#### 2. Is India losing its textile dominance?

Not yet. India remains a major global player. However, competitive pressure is increasing.

#### 3. How could Indian cotton farmers be affected?

If Bangladesh shifts to US-origin cotton to qualify for tariff benefits, Indian cotton exports to Bangladesh may decline.

#### 4. What is the solution for India?

Faster implementation of textile parks, better scale integration, value addition, and stronger global branding.
