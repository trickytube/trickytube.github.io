West Bengal politics has once again entered storm mode, and this time the trigger is a combination of ED raids, a political consultancy firm, and a sensational “pen drive” claim by Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. As the countdown to the 2026 Assembly elections begins, the political temperature in the state is clearly rising.

### What was happened?
The controversy erupted after the[ **Enforcement Directorate (ED)**](https://enforcementdirectorate.gov.in/) conducted raids on the Kolkata office of [I-PAC](https://www.indianpac.com/), a well-known political consultancy firm that has worked closely with the Trinamool Congress (TMC). The move instantly turned into a political flashpoint, with Mamata Banerjee stepping in personally and accusing the Centre of misusing investigative agencies to harass opposition parties.

###  WB CM-Mamata Banerjee’s Explosive Allegations
Mamata Banerjee’s dramatic claim took this issue to another level-that she possesses pen drives containing information against Union Home Minister Shri Amit Shah. According to her, the contents are so serious that if revealed, they could “shock the entire country.” She warned that if the central government continues to use agencies like the ED to target the party like TMC, she would not hesitate to make the alleged evidence public. This statement instantly grabbed national headlines and turned a legal probe into a full-blown political battle.

### Why The ED Raided I-PAC?
The ED clarified that the raid was conducted under the [**Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002**](https://enforcementdirectorate.gov.in/pmla), and is linked to an ongoing investigation into the West Bengal coal smuggling case. The agency claims that the case involves illegal mining, extortion from coal transporters, and laundering of money through shell companies.
I-PAC, founded by Prashant Kishor, is a professional election consultancy firm that works with multiple political parties across India. Though Prashant Kishor formally separated from I-PAC in 2021, the firm continues to play a key role in election strategy, data analytics, and campaign planning. The ED insists that I-PAC is not being targeted for its political affiliations but because it is allegedly linked, directly or indirectly, to financial transactions under investigation.

### TMC'S Reactions on this Raid
The TMC, however, sees this very differently. Mamata Banerjee accused the BJP-led central government of weaponizing central agencies to disrupt her party’s election preparation. She went to the I-PAC office herself, questioned the timing of the raids, and alleged that sensitive political documents were being targeted.
Using unusually strong language (Nasty Naughty Home Minister), she held Amit Shah politically responsible for the ED’s actions and claimed that investigative agencies no longer function independently. Several TMC leaders and MPs also staged protests, calling the raid an attack on democracy.

### ED AND BJP'S Reactions on Mamata's accusation
The BJP and the ED rejected these accusations outright. The ED mentioned that the raid was case-specific, not party-specific, and emphasized that no organization is above the law if money laundering is suspected.
The BJP, on the other hand, accused Mamata Banerjee of trying to obstruct the investigation and divert attention from serious corruption allegations by playing the victim card ahead of elections.

### The Coal Smuggling Case
The controversy of coal smuggling case, which the ED claims involves politically influential individuals. Mamata Banerjee’s mention of pen drives allegedly linking Amit Shah to the scam appears to be a strategic counter-offensive, aiming to shift the spotlight toward BJP-linked figures.
However, as of now, no independent verification has been made regarding the existence or contents of these pen drives.

### Conclusion
The investigation is still ongoing, and no court has yet delivered a final verdict. What is clear, though, is that the political battle lines are being drawn early for the 2026 West Bengal elections. Whether this case turns out to be a genuine corruption exposure or a high-stakes political drama will only be known with time.
